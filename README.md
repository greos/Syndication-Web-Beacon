This is a small web app to create a tracking pixel / Web beacon.
The web beacon is used to track user interaction of republished articles on third-party websites.

The reason for this:
Articles created by their original publishers are often scraped or intentially re-published on third-party sites by approved syndicators.
The idea is for our third-party syndicators to allow the original publishers to know where content is being published to and how many visits to these articles third-parties receive.
